<h1>API</h1>

<p>
Soon, Warp will have a performance-and-composition-oriented web interface usable by musicians without requiring anyone to code.</p>

<p>
Until then (Fall 2020), the public Python API is available to those wanting to use, explore, and extend Warp.  Even once the UI is available, the API will allow programmatically generated compositions
and can be very powerful, and will be able to generate song files that can be loaded with the UI.
</p>

<p>
API examples are part of the project repo, but you can also browse them on <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq/src/master/examples/api/">BitBucket.</A>
</p>

<p>
The public API is considered (mostly) stable and isolates users from internal code changes within warp.  Methods outside of "public.py" are subject to change.
</p>

<h2>Running the API Example Demos</h2>

<p>
The API demos are live demos that send MIDI events to your software, hardware, or DAW.  Listening to them will require you set up some
tracks or devices that can receive MIDI.  To run them:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}cd checkout_location
cd examples/api/
PYTHONPATH=. python3 any_example.py
{{ end_code() }}


<p>
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq/src/master/examples/api/">The API demos</A> are written to use a specific MIDI interface but if you don't have yours named the same as ours, you can set an environment variable.
On a MAC, this is done as follows:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}WARP_MIDI_DEVICE="My Device Name" PYTHONPATH=. python3 any_example.py
{{ end_code() }}

Or alternatively:

{{ begin_code() }}export WARP_MIDI_DEVICE="My Device Name"
PYTHONPATH=. python3 any_example.py
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
Most of the examples use one or two MIDI tracks.  Just search for "tracks' in the code and see what gets set up, and try to choose some instruments that sound like a good
match.  If you need to tweak the track numbers in the instrument definitions in those files, that's also fine.
</p>

<p>
In addition to reading, trying, and tweaking the example code, we recommend reading the other documentation sections, so you will know what sort of variations to try out in the API.
In particular, the API examples only show *some* of the interesting things you can do with the expressions language and transforms.  As you explore the docs,
you will be able to use the API to construct more interesting and varied compositions.
</p>

<h2>API Walkthrough</h2>

Here's a step by step walkthrough of the "00_kick_snare.py" example from the examples folder.  We start off with some python imports so remember
to set the environment variable <i>PYTHONPATH</i> so you can find Warp's checkout directory.

{{ begin_code() }}from warpseq.api import demo
from warpseq.api.callbacks import Callbacks, DefaultCallback
from warpseq.api.public import Api as WarpApi
{{ end_code() }}

Now we create an API handle and set the tempo:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup API and song
api = WarpApi()
api.song.edit(tempo=120)
{{ end_code() }}

We define what instruments we want to use by device and MIDI channel.  The "suggest_device" method takes
the midi channel from the "WARP_MIDI_DEVICE" environment variable if the default device isn't found:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup instruments
DEVICE = demo.suggest_device(api, 'IAC Driver IAC Bus 1')
api.instruments.add('kick_inst', device=DEVICE, channel=1, min_octave=0, base_octave=0, max_octave=10)
api.instruments.add('snare_inst', device=DEVICE, channel=2, min_octave=0, base_octave=0, max_octave=10)
{{ end_code() }}

Now that we have instruments, we add the instruments to tracks.

{{ begin_code() }}# setup tracks
api.tracks.add(name='kick', instrument='kick_inst', muted=False)
api.tracks.add(name='snare', instrument='snare_inst', muted=False)
{{ end_code() }}

We can add any number of built-in or user scales.  As this is a drum example, we're not really
going to use them though, so see the other examples for scale demos:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup scales
api.scales.add(name='C-major', note='C', octave=3, scale_type='major')
{{ end_code() }}

Now we lay out some drum patterns - patterns are just simple arrays:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup patterns
api.patterns.add(name='kick_4_4',  slots="C1 . .  . C1 . .  . C1 . .  . C1 . .  .".split())
api.patterns.add(name='snare_4_4', slots=".  . D1 . . .  D1 . .  . D1 . .  . D1 .".split())
api.patterns.add(name='kick_alt',  slots="C1 . C1 . C1 . .  . C1 . .  . C1 . .  .".split())
api.patterns.add(name='snare_alt', slots=".  . D1 . .  . D1 D1 .  D1 D1 . .  D1 D1 .".split())
{{ end_code() }}

Now we add some scenes:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup scenes
api.scenes.add(name='scene_1', scale='C-major', auto_advance=True)
api.scenes.add(name='scene_2', scale='C-major', auto_advance=True)
{{ end_code() }}

And some clips, which sit at the intersection of "scenes" and "tracks" in our virtual grid:

{{ begin_code() }}# setup clips
api.clips.add(name='s1k1', scene='scene_1', track='kick', patterns=['kick_4_4'], repeat=4, auto_scene_advance=True)
api.clips.add(name='s1s1', scene='scene_1', track='snare', patterns=['snare_4_4'], repeat=4)
# change the drum pattern, repeat=None implies infinite repeat.
api.clips.add(name='s2k1', scene='scene_2', track='kick', patterns=['kick_alt'], repeat=4, auto_scene_advance=True)
api.clips.add(name='s2s1', scene='scene_2', track='snare', patterns=['snare_alt'], repeat=4)
{{ end_code() }}

And we set the track playing... it will complete when finished or you can hit Ctrl+C to stop it.

{{ begin_code() }}# play starting on the first scene - Ctrl+C to exit.
api.player.loop('scene_1')
{{ end_code() }}

This is just a simple drum pattern, so it will sound best if you put a kick drum sound on Track 1, and a snare
sound on Track 2.  The rest of the <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq/src/master/examples/api/">API Examples</A>
are more melodic and show off more features, though it seemed best to start with the basics.

{{ begin_info_block() }}
The API above will always be available for generative composition - but will also be used to power the backend of
our web interface, which is next up in development!  As mentioned, look for the first release of the web interface
sometime in the Fall of 2020 - but feel free to enjoy and compose tracks with the API today!
