<h1>API</h1>

<p>
The end goal of Warp is to have a fully functional web interface usable by musicians without requiring anyone to code, however
there are two reasons why you may want an API.
</p>

<ul>
<li>The Web UI isn't available yet! - which is currently true. Look for something in Fall of 2020!</li>
<li>The API allows fancy generative compositions and allows you to see all of your patterns on the same screen at once</li>
</ul>

API docs to come (BELOW) -- FIXME.
