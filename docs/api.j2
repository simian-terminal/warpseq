<h1>API</h1>

<p>
Soon, Warp will have a performance-and-composition-oriented web interface usable by musicians without requiring anyone to code.</p>

<p>
Until then (Fall 2020), the
Python API is available to those wanting to use, explore, and extend Warp.  Even once the UI is available, the API will allow programatically generated compositions
and can be very powerful, and will be able to generate song files that can be loaded with the UI.
</p>

<p>
API examples are part of the project repo, but you can also browse them on <A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq/src/master/examples/api/">BitBucket.</A>
</p>

<p>
The public API is considered (fairly) stable and isolates users from internal code changes within warp.  Methods outside of "public.py" are subject to change.
