<h1>Song</h1>

<p>
This chapter will explain some terms in Warp, and compare them a bit to what you may expect with audio production tools you may be familiar with.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>Each Warp file is called a song.  Each song definition is self contained.  There is no "computer specific" setup in Warp.</li>
<li>A song must define a default tempo, though this may be overriden in a {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('clip') }}. The default is 120. Change it.</li>
<li>A song may define a default {{ doc('scale') }}, though this may also be overriden in a {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('clip') }}.</li>
<li>Songs can be saved and loaded to files, and files should be openable by any future version of Warp.</li>
<li>Songs are technically JSON files, but you hand edit them at your own risk.  If that seems appealing, see the {{ doc('api') }}</li>
</ul>
</p>

{{ begin_info_block() }}
If you don't want to set up each {{ doc('device','Device') }} or {{ doc('instrument','Instrument') }} each time, a good idea is to make an empty
Warp song called "template.warp". This is also a good place to keep your favorite user {{ doc('scale','Scale') }} definitions.
