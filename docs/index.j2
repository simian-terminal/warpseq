<h1>Warpseq MIDI Sequencer</h1>

Warp is a music-theory aware MIDI sequencer. It is inspired by popular DAWs like Ableton Live, and hardware units like
the Sequentix Cirklon and Elektron Monomachine and designed for (eventual) rapid-access during live performance as
well as deliberate long-form compositions, with a goal on achieving increased sonic variety and experimentation as
compared to traditional piano-roll DAW tools.

Warp allows for advanced pattern sequences that understand scales natively, including chords, and transpositions.
Additionally, it allow inter-track and randomness expressions  in many varieties.  Particular attention has been paid to
arpeggiators, which have become an flexible engine for manipulating other patterns.

While the concept of clips should be familiar to Ableton and Bitwig users, here "Clips" can consist of multiple
symlinked patterns, multiple scales, and octave shifts, each with their own arpeggiator choices.  For more information,
see {{ doc('concepts') }} and {{ doc('expressions') }}.

Warp is implemented in python, fully free (Apache 2 licensed), and will feature a performance oriented web interface.
In the current developer-beta-release state, using Warpseq requires some basic Python experience (see {{ doc('api') }},
though the UI is in development.

Warpseq will continue to grow and gain new features with future releases.

See {{ doc('installation') }} for how to get going, or {{ doc('club') }} for how to get some great inside information
and to support the project.
