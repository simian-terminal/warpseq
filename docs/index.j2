<h1>Warpseq MIDI Sequencer</h1>

Warp is a highly music-theory aware MIDI sequencer inspired by popular DAWs like Ableton live, and hardware units like the Sequentix Cirklon and Elektron Monomachine.
In many cases, it improved on these concepts with new/different features.  It is designed for rapid-access during live performance as well as deliberate long-form composition.

Warp allows for advanced pattern sequences that understand scales natively, chords, and transpositions, and will allow inter-track and randomness expressions 
in many varieties.  Particular attention has been paid to arpeggiators, which are essentially meta-patterns for manipulating other patterns, and are very 
powerful.  For more information, see {{ doc('concepts') }} and {{ doc('expressions') }}.

Additionally, it embraces the concept of patterns and arpeggiators being seperate from the idea of clips, making it easier to reuse patterns between scenes and tracks.

Warp is implemented in python, fully free (Apache 2 licensed) and will feature an nCurses-based interface.

Warpseq will continue to grow and gain new features with future releases.
