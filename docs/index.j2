<h1>Warp MIDI Sequencer</h1>

<p>
Warp is an advanced music theory aware MIDI sequencer for software and hardware synthesizers. It is open source (Apache 2 licensed), and built in Python.
Warp has an emphasis on allowing carefully sculptable randomness, key-changes, tempo changes, and pattern variations, all powered by an feature-rich expression language.
</p>

<p>
Warp is inspired by tools such as Ableton Live, and hardware like the Sequentix Cirklon and the Elektron Monomachine. Like Ableton is grid based,
but the pattern engine is infinitely more powerful. Instead of using a piano roll, patterns (and modifiers called "transforms") are simply typed in.
You will probably use Warp with your DAW open in the background, either recording audio or MIDI inputs from Warp.
