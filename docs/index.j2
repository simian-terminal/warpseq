<h1>Warp MIDI Sequencer</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Warp is a revolutionary new music-theory-focused MIDI sequencer for software and hardware synthesizers, designed for both composition and dynamic live performance.</p>

<p>
Inspirations include some of our favorite hardware and software such as the Sequentix Cirklon, the Elektron Monomachine, and Ableton Live. Like Ableton, Warp is grid based, yet
instead of a piano roll, patterns are typed in. With an emphasis on selective randomness, choreographed key-changes, and emergent behaviors, you haven't seen anything like it.

Warp is currently in a developer beta preview stage. For now, you'll need to write a small amount of {{ doc('api', 'Python') }} to compose songs.
The GUI releasing later this year will make it more accessible to musicians everywhere. Questions, ideas, or feedback? <A HREF="mailto:michael@michaeldehaan.net">Email Michael</A>.

<p>Warp is a free program - it is Apache 2 licensed and written in Python.</p>
