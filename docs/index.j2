<h1>Warp MIDI Sequencer</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Warp is a new music-theory-aware MIDI sequencer for software and hardware synthesizers, designed for composition and dynamic live performance.</p>

<p>
Warp is inspired by some of our favorite tools such as Ableton Live, the Sequentix Cirklon, and the Elektron Monomachine. Like Ableton, Warp is grid based, yet
instead of using a piano roll, patterns are simply typed in. You will probably use Warp with your DAW open in the background, either recording audio or incoming MIDI from Warp.
</p>

<p>Warp is open source (Apache 2 licensed), and built in Python.
Warp has an emphasis on enabling selective randomness, choreographed key-changes, and emergent new musical frontiers through a powerful built-in transform language.
You haven't seen anything like it.
