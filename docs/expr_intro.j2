<h1>Expressions</h1>

<p>
In Warpseq, when we define notes or chords in a pattern, we can simply type in symbols for the notes and chords, or we can also
use more complex expressions. These expressions can involve randomness and other musical features, to add variety to compositions.
</p>

<p>
The goal of Warp is for any user to easily express high-level compositional intent, and that includes variation, such as subtle note changes
on certain steps as commonly found in acid or minimal techno OR insane arpeggiated chord sequences only a robotic Mozart could pull off.
To achieve this, we need tools -- a language -- for expressing this.
</p>

<p>
Expressions are used not only in describing what notes play, they are also used in {{ doc('transform', 'Transforms') }}.  As we have explained
earlier in the documentation, transforms move across the notes that would be in a {{ doc('pattern') }}, and can modify them in a number of ways.  They can use
all of the {{ doc('patterns', 'Patterns') }} expressed anywhere else in this chapter.
</p>

<p>
All of these systems work in the concept of the current {{ doc('scale') }}, so they always stay musical. Yet it is still possible to express sharps and flats outside the scale (aka "blue notes"), something
that is usually not possible in classical DAWS with "force to scale" features.
</p>

<p>
We don't want to overwhelm anyone, but there is a lot of power here. If this is confusing, we recommend looking at some of the example songs that come with Warp, and things should make a lot
more sense in context.  You can then think of this more as a reference manual and come back to it as needed, or when you feel like learning more features.
