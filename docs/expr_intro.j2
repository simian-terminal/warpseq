<h1>Expressions</h1>

{{ begin_info_block() }}
Right now, Warp is in a developer-only beta mode, where there's a great Python API, but no user interface available yet. Once the UI is available, this section
will morph into a user guide and will also include screenshots.

<p>
In Warpseq, notes and chords are written in text. When we define notes or chords in a {{ doc('pattern') }}, we can simply type in symbols for the notes and chords.

<h2>Notes and Chords Are Only The Start</h2>

<p>
The goal of Warp is for any user to easily express high-level compositional intent, and that includes random or evolving variations. These variations many include such as subtle note
or MIDI CC changes on certain steps as commonly found in acid or minimal techno OR insane arpeggiated chord sequences that only a robotic Mozart could pull off.
To achieve this, we need tools -- a language -- for expressing this. Warp expressions are that language -- designed to be rapidly entered and edited in with a keyboard,
rather than slowly placed via a piano roll interface.

<h2>Transforms Implement MIDI Effects</h2>

<p>
Expressions in {{ doc('patterns','Patterns') }} are not only used in describing what notes play, but also in {{ doc('transform', 'Transforms') }}.  As we have explained
earlier in the documentation, transforms move across the notes that would be in a {{ doc('pattern') }}, and can modify them in a number of ways - which will grow with
each future release of the Warp program.
</p>

<hr/>
<h2>Everything Is Scale Aware</h2>

<p>
Expressions in both {{ doc('pattern','Patterns') }} and {{ doc('transform', 'Tranforms') }} work in the context of the current {{ doc('scale') }}, so they always stay musical.
Yet it is still possible to express sharps and flats outside the scale (aka "blue notes"), something that is usually not possible in classical DAWS with "force to scale" features.
If you express a "E4", however, that note will always be an E4, meaning you can control drum synths without them being altered by a scale change.

<h2>Ready To Get Started Learning Expressions?</h2>

<p>
We don't want to overwhelm anyone, but there is a lot of power to explore here. If this seems confusing, we recommend looking at some of the example songs that come with Warp (see {{ doc('api','Api') }} for now),
and things should make a lot more sense in context.  You can then think of this documentation section more as a reference manual and come back to it as needed, or when you feel like learning more features.
Explore each chapter and feel free to not use everything at once - eventually, you'll feel like exploring and trying out more features as things become second nature.
