<h1>Clip</h1>
<hr/>

Users of popular grid-based DAWs like Ableton or Bitwig may be familiar with clips.  Clips are, simply put, a small piece of something playable that contains MIDI notes.
A {{ doc('song') }} is what happens when you arrange multiple clips by {{ doc('scene') }} and {{ doc('track') }} in a grid.

{{ begin_info_block() }}
{{ doc('pattern','Patterns') }}, {{ doc('transform', 'transforms') }}, and {{ doc('scale','scales') }} referenced clips are only symbolic links - which may make sense if you have a programming background.  What this means is that if one has a pattern named "groove1" and later
reconfigures what notes and chords are in groove1, Warp will change in all clips that use that pattern.  This makes it easy to try out both small and large scale variations in a song without tedious reprogramming.
{{ end_info_block() }}


<h2>Basic Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>A clip belongs to a {{ doc('scene') }} (horizontally) and a {{ doc('track') }} (Vertically) in the {{ doc('song') }} grid.</li>
<li>A clip contains a list of one or more {{ doc('pattern', 'Patterns') }} that play in order, resulting in notes.</li>
<li>Playing a clip will stop any other clips that are playing in the same {{ doc('track') }} as the clip.</li>
<li>A clip may have one or more {{ doc('scale','Scales') }}.  These scales are used for each playing {{ doc('pattern') }} and are rotated in a loop as each pattern advances or the clip repeats.</li>
<li>If a clip does not have a {{ doc('scale') }} assigned, the {{ doc('scale') }} can come from the {{ doc('scene') }}, and if not set there, the {{ doc('song') }}.
<li>A clip may also define a tempo multiplier rate such as 0.5 (half speed) or 2 (double speed)</li>
<li>A clip may have one or more {{ doc('transform', 'Transforms') }}, which are powerful tools that modify the currently playing {{ doc('pattern') }}.  These are used in rotation just as the {{ doc('scale', 'Scales') }} are.</li>
<li>A clip may have a list of tempo_shifts, which are added or subtracted to the tempo of each playing {{ doc('pattern') }}. These rotate similarly as scales or transforms.
<li>A clip may be set to repeat indefinitely (it will end if the scene ends), or for a finite number of times.</li>
<li>A clip may be set to advance the {{ doc('scene') }} when the clip completes. This is off by default.</li>
<li>A clip may trigger another specific clip when it completes. This does not occur if the clip is set to advance a {{ doc('scene') }}.</li>
</ul>
