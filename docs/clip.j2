<h3>Clip</h3>

<ul>
<li>A clip primarily contains a list of patterns that can be manually triggered to play in sequence</li>
<li>A clip belongs to a Scene (horizontally) and a track (Vertically).</li>
<li>Playing a clip will stop any other clips that are playing in the same track.</li>
<li>A clip may override the tempo on a scene or song.</li>
<li>A clip may have one or more scales.  These scales are used for each pattern, but the list of scales may be of a different length from the list of patterns.</li>
<li>A clip may have one or more octave_shifts and scale degree_shifts that apply to the currrently playing pattern.  These are used in rotation just as scales are, above.  These are easily implemented with mod_expressions and can be removed.</li>
<li>A clip may have a list of tempo_shifts, which are added or subtracted to the tempo of each playing pattern. These are used in rotation, just as the scales are, above.
<li>A clip may have one or more transforms, which are expressions that modify the currently playing pattern.  These are used in rotation just as the scales are, above.</li>
<li>A clip may be set to repeat indefinitely (it will end if the scene ends), or for a finite number of times.</li>
<li>A clip may trigger another clip when it completes</li>
<li>A clip may be programmed to advance the scene when the clip completes. This is off by default.</li>
<li>A clip may have a length. If set, patterns will stop early at this point, rather than using all of the pattern symbols.</li>
</ul>

<h1>A simple clip explanation</h1>

A simple clip may conceptually have the following properties:

{{ begin_code() }}
tempo : 140
patterns: verse, chorus, verse2, chorus, bridge, verse
scales: f-pentatonic
{{ end_code() }}

In this example, the patterns will play in order.  If there was a tempo or scale set on the {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('clip') }} it will be overriden by the selections of
140 bpm and the F-pentatonic scale.

<h2>A very complex clip explanation</h2>

Clips can be simple or they can be more detailed. Here's how a maximally complex (and probably non-musical!) example might look.

{{ begin_code() }}
tempo: 140
tempo_shifts: [ 0, 10, 20 ]
scales: f-pentatonic, g-minor
octave_shifts, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, -1, 2
auto_scene_advance: True
repeat: 10
transforms: [ arpeggiate1, stutter2, chaos1 ]
{{ end_code() }}

In this example:

<ul>
<li>The base tempo will override the {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('song') }} at 140 bpm.</li>
<li>The first pattern will actually play at 140bpm, but every 2nd pattern at 150bpm and every 3rd pattern at 150bpm.</li>
<li>Every other pattern will alternate between the F-Pentatonic and G-Minor scales.</li>
<li>Every fifth pattern will be played one octave higher, the sixth one lower, and the seventh two higher</li>
<li>When the clip is finished, the entire next scene will advance.</li>
<li>Alternate clips are arpeggiated, sliced and diced, and munged by different transforms, in rotation. See {{ doc('transform', 'transforms') }}.
<li>The sequence of two the two named patterns will repeat 20 times (10 patterns each)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Because the various modifiers have different lengths, nothing will be exactly the same!  With {{ doc('transform', 'transforms') }} and even
{{ doc('expr_info', 'mod expressions') }} applied to the patterns themselves, this can be even more complex than it looks! But don't worry if this
seems advanced,  you can use as little features of Warp or as many as you want.  It's ok to start slow and learn to make more animated compositions over time.
