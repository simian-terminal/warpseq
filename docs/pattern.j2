<h3>Pattern</h3>

<ul>
<li>A pattern represents an ordered series of {{ doc('expr_intro', 'Expressions') }} that evaluate into notes or chords
<li>Patterns include strings like "1", "IV", or "C4sus4" or even "C4sus4;O+1;cc0=50".</li>
<li>Patterns can include velocity and MIDI CC information.
<li>A pattern may define an octave_shift to be applied to the current {{ doc('scale') }}, which applies after the base octave of the instrument.
<li>A pattern may define a Tempo to override the tempo of the {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('song') }}, if not further overriden by the {{ doc('clip') }}.
<li>A pattern may define a Scale to override the scale of the {{ doc('scene') }} or {{ doc('song') }}, if not further overriden by a {{ doc('clip') }}.
</ul>

<h2>A Quick Example</h2>

The simplest possible pattern is a scale:

{{ begin_code() }}
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{{ end_code() }}

Here are some major and minor chords in a pattern:

{{ begin_code() }}
I
IV
V
i
iv
v
{{ end_code() }}

Here is a pattern some ties ("-") and rests (" "):

{{ begin_code() }}
1
2
3
-

1
-
2
-
3
-

{{ end_code() }}

Patterns can be much more complex. For more, see the {{ doc('expr_into', 'Expressions') }} chapter.
