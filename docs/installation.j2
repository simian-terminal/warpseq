<h1>Installation</h1>

<i>First off, thank you for interest in trying out Warp!</i>

{{ begin_info_block() }}
Warp is in a developer-only beta phase through Fall 2020 as we work on the user interface.  The instructions below cover
setting up the API and will include full install instructions later. For now, we will assume some basic Python development and
command line skills.  As we evolve, these instructions will evolve to make them more accessible to everyone. If you would like
to help improve our documentation, see {{ doc('contributing','contributing') }}.
{{ end_info_block() }}

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<i>Warp should work on most any commputer.</i>

<p>
First install <i>python3</i> and <i>git</i> if you do not already have them.  On a Mac, we recommend installing <i>python3</i> from homebrew:
</p>

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}
brew install python3
brew install git
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Checkout</h2>

<p>
Now clone the project into a directory:
</p>

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}cd wherever
git clone https://laserllama@bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq.git
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Libraries</h2>

<p>
Now install the dependencies:
</p>

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}pip3 install -r requirements.txt
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Creating a Virtual Bus</h2>

<p>
If you want to use Warp with software synthesizers, you will need to create a Virtual Bus in your operating system to talk to them if you do not already have one.
Ableton has already written some great documentation on this, so we suggest following those:
</p>

<p>
<A HREF="https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209774225-How-to-setup-a-virtual-MIDI-bus">How To Setup A Virtual MIDI Bus [Ableton.com]</A>.
</p>

<p>
You can skip step 5 in the above document unless you also use Ableton and haven't already set that up.
</p>

<h2>Ready?</h2>

<p>
We are ready to go.  At the current state of development, only the python API is available.  The UI is coming soon.
To try out Warpseq from the API, run one of the examples:
</p>

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}cd examples/api
python3 tests/00_kick_snare.py
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
The program may prompt you about selecting a MIDI interface.
</p>

<p>
When the UI is available, there will just be a few more install steps for Web UI dependencies.
