<h1>Installation Hello</h1>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

First install python3 and git if you do not already have it.  On a Mac, we recommend getting Python3 from homebrew:

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}
brew install python3
brew install git
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Checkout</h2>

Now clone the project into a directory:

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}
git clone git clone https://laserllama@bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq.git
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Libraries</h2>

Now install the dependencies:

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}
pip3 install -f requirements.txt
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Ready?</h2>

We are ready to go.  At the current state of development, only the python API is available.  The UI is coming soon.
To try out Warpseq from the API, run one of the examples:

{{ begin_code(language='bash') }}
python3 tests/api.py
{{ end_code() }}

Except this won't probably work, because you need to select your MIDI interface.  Hack the example for now
where you see "Device" to match the name of a device you have.  FIXME: this instruction will change.
