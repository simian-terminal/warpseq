<p>
For Warp to be able to send MIDI notes, it needs a way to send them. A device is any computer operating system visible MIDI Device, such as your USB MIDI interface or a virtual one like an Apple IAC Audio Bus.
</p>

{{ begin_info_block() }}
In OS X, creating an IAC Bus (see {{ doc('installation') }}) will allow Warpseq to talk to software synths.
{{ end_info_block() }}

<p>Warp is targeted just as much at hardware synths as software synths, and can speak to multiple devices and instruments at once - including a mix of hardware and software.

{{ begin_info_block() }}
When you start up a new {{ doc('song') }}, all the current MIDI Devices on your computer should be added to the {{ doc('song') }} automatically, so you can use them.  If you open someone else's
{{ doc('song') }} file, you may need to manually add some new devices and then reconfigure your {{ doc('instrument', 'Instrument') }} definitions in order to play the song on your software
and hardware.
