<h1>Variable Engine</h1>
<hr/>

<p>
Warp contains a variable engine where variables can be shared between tracks and scenes.  The variables
are set and accessed as follows, and CAN be used in conjunction with the randomness features above.
</p>

<p>
Assume the following {{ doc('pattern', 'Pattern') }} example:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}1 $x=5 $y=10
2 $z=20
3
4 cc0=$x
5 $y=0:50
6 cc1=$y
7
8 cc0=0:$y
9
10 cc0=$x
11
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
The above example is a little crazy, but the basics are that variables can be substituted anywhere a number can
be in a modifier expression.  Variables can also hold strings, like in this {{ doc('pattern') }} example:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}_ $x=power,major,minor
4 ch=$x
8 ch=$x
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
In the above example, the first in the pattern is silent, and then we play two chords of the same type.
</p>

<p>
The variable engine can be mostly ignored if you don't want to use it, but could be interesting in more
complex works.
</p>

<p>
The examples below show regular patterns, but all of these modifiers can also be used in {{ doc('transform', 'Transform') }} effects as well.
</p>

{{ begin_info_block() }}
Variables are part of a global namespace and are available to all scenes, clips, and tracks.
{{ end_info_block() }}
