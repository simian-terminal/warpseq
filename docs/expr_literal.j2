<h1>Expressing Literal Notes</h1>

<p>
Warp can represent scale notes or just specific notes.  For starters, let's learn specific notes that won't be affected by the current
{{ doc('scale','Scale') }}.  This is something you will need to do when using drum synths, but otherwise, you probably won't use this
feature very often.
</p>

<p>
For a starter example, think about playing a musical scale.  If the scale is "C-major" and we start on the 4th octave: then that scale is:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}C4
D4
E4
F4
G4
A4
B4
C4
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
That, as simple as it is, is a valid pattern in Warpseq.  You can program notes in like that if you want and would just enter them in order. In the UI,
you would put each on a line by itself. However, as we mentioned, these symbols won't respond to any scale settings in Warp.  They'll just stick to what you input.
</p>

<p>
To continue, you can access black keys as well, as either sharps or flats, as is your preference:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}
Eb4
C#4
{{ end_code() }}

{{ begin_info_block() }}
If you want to input notes or chords that instead follow the scale settings -- which is in general what you want to do when writing anything that isn't a percussion track -- see {{ doc('expr_scale_notes') }}.
{{ end_info_block() }}
