<h2>Randomness</h2>
<hr/>

<p>
Additional types of randomness in Warp are not just {{ doc("expr_mod","Mod Expressions") }} themselves (like "p" -- the probability expression), but are accessed instead in the <i>values</i> of mod expressions.
These enable features like randomized note or octave jumps, randomized MIDI CC values, or randomized velocity.  This randomness is not applied to the entire Clip, as is offered in most commercial DAWs, but can
be engaged specifically on certain note steps in a pattern, making the concept infinitely more powerful.  These are ideas popularized by Elektron's parameter locks and further refined in hardware
like the Cirklon.  Warp puts a slightly different spin on them, providing easier entry, and in some cases, some new capabilities.  Should these concepts want to be applied to an entire clip, though, they are easy
to apply in batch by writing a {{ doc('transform', 'Transform') }}.

<h3>Random Range</h3>

"Range" picks a value between a range. The inclusive start and end of the range are separated by a colon (":").
In the example below, we randomly jump the third note in a scale pattern by between 0 and 4 octaves each time it plays:

{{ begin_code() }}1
2
3 O+0:4
4
5
6
7
8
{{ end_code() }}

<hr/>
<h3>Random Choice</h3>

"Choice" involves choosing from a list, which allows some control over probability distribution if an entry
appears in a list more than once.  The choices in the list are separated by commas (",")

{{ begin_code() }}1 O+0,2,3
2 O+1,3
3
4
5
6
7
{{ end_code() }}

In the above example, the first note (which is the first note of the selected scale) jumps 0, 2 or 3 octaves, but the chance of an octave jump is only 50%, because two of the values
are zero.  The second note jumps either 1 or 3 octaves.

<p>
Choice is also the only random form that works with non-numeric values, such as this random chord type example:
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}I
3 ch=major,minor
{{ end_code() }}

<p>
In this example, the first chord is definitively a major chord, and the second note is either a major or minor chord, with equal chance.
</p>

<p>
This next quick example shows a 1/3 chance of a minor chord and a 2/3 chance of a major chord.
</p>

{{ begin_code() }}I
3 ch=major,major,minor
{{ end_code() }}

<h2>Using Randomness for Humanization</h2>

Humanizing otherwise repetitive patterns is a popular feature in many sequencers. Below is an example
of humanizing velocity in Warp while playing a two octave scale, with every four notes being full volume:

{{ begin_code() }}1 v=127
2 v=60:80
3 v=60:80
4 v=60:80
5 v=127
6 v=60:80
7 v=60:80
8 v=60:80
9 v=127
10 v=60:80
11 v=60:80
12 v=60:80
13 v=127
14 v=60:80
15 v=60:80
16 v=60:80
{{ end_code() }}

Because MIDI CC's are sticky between notes, assigning random values to CC values can work like a tempo-synced sample
and hold.  The example below changes twice in each pattern iteration:

{{ begin_code() }}1 cc0=0:127
2
3
4
5
6 cc0=0:127
7
8
9
10
{{ end_code() }}

This could be done with multiple MIDI CCs, changing them at different points in the pattern:

{{ begin_code() }}1 cc0=0:127
2
3 cc1=20:127
4
5
6 cc0=0:127
7
8 cc2=40:80
9
10
{{ end_code() }}
