<h1>Scale Notes & Chords</h1>

Input of notes that follow {{ doc('scale') }} settings within Warp follow a varient of something called "Roman Numeral Analysis".
In short, Warp uses arabic numerals to indicate degrees along a scale, and roman numerals to represent basic chords. Jazz fans will
object to this, and say this can't possibly represent all the types of interesting and useful chords, and they are correct - but bear
with us.


<h2>A Scale Example</h2>

Here is the same scale mentioned in {{ doc('expr_literal') }} in a way that will work for any 7-note {{ doc('scale') }} setting:

{{ begin_code() }} 1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
{{ end_code() }}

This means that we can define a {{ doc('pattern') }} and then the pattern can be then used in any clip using any scale we want.

{{ begin_info_block() }}
Most other sequencer programs and DAWs do not natively understand scales, but instead
"force" notes to the nearest scale note.  This means multiple note entries might map to the same note, or it may be unclear
if something rounds up or down.  Of greater concern, in these force-to-scale systems, the ability to use accidentals is lost.
{{ end_info_block() }}

<h3>Roman Numeral Chords</h3>

Chords can be expressed as Roman numerals:

{{ begin_code() }}
I
IV
V
{{ end_code() }}

This notation is commonly used to denote chord progressions.  Like the arabic numerals above, it is nice because it doesn't care what scale you are in.

Lowercase roman numerals represent minor chords:

{{ begin_code() }}
i
iv
v
{{ end_code() }}

More advanced types can be represented using their base notes and chord type:

{{ begin_code() }}
1 ch=sus4
2 ch=major
4 ch=power
{{ end_code() }}

This is a bit of a spoiler as this refers to "Mod Expressions", covered immediately below.

For reference the built-in chord types you can use this way are:

<ul>
<li>minor</li>
<li>major</li>
<li>dim</li>
<li>aug</li>
<li>sus4</li>
<li>sus2</li>
<li>fourth</li>
<li>power</li>
<li>fifth</li>
<li>M6</li>
<li>m6</li>
<li>dom7</li>
<li>M7</li>
<li>m7</li>
<li>aug7</li>
<li>dim7</li>
<li>mM7</li>
</ul>

That's a little jazzier, we just don't get to use the roman numeral syntax.
