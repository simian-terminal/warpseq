<h1>Contributing</h1>

<p>
Warp is provided to you under an Apache2 open source license.  Contributions are very welcome and we want Warp to be a tool for everyone.
Copyright is held by <i>all contributors</i> without assignment, and therefore, the license can never be changed and it cannot be re-licensed
to anyone under different terms.  This is by-design.
</p>

<p>
To contribute, you should first discuss what features you would like to add with <A HREF="mailto:michael@michaeldehaan.net">Michael</A> over
email, to avoid duplicate efforts and to assure compatible goals. Then, when ready, submit a pull request to
<A HREF="https://bitbucket.org/laserllama/warpseq/src/master/">warpseq on BitBucket</A>.  We'll generally be very interested in code review,
so this is why up front discussion of where to implement a feature may save some extra effort.
</p>

<p>
While absolutely not required, it will be easier to submit pull requests if you are also following {{ doc('club', 'club') }} news.
This also gets you access to discord chat, which is a better way to talk about ideas than on BitBucket or email - because it is a space all contributors can
talk together at once. You may also wish to follow <A HREF="http://twitter.com/warpseq">@warpseq</A> on twitter for release news.
</p>

<p>
We have one very important rule: Any additions must take care to not break song files of existing users.  Listen to your song file tests, think about all the error paths,
be paranoid, and test it thoroughly before submitting any additions or changes.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for interest in this project and we look forward to working and talking with you!
