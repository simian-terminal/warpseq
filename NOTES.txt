NOTES
=====

BACKEND
=======

* test changing clips
* make sure there's a short cut method for clicking play on a scene that plays all the clips
* expand expressions to allow for more, like intra-track grab (ModExpression class)
* increase error handling in expressions using custom exception types

* UI mockups
** Instrument
** Pattern Edit
** Arp Edit
** Scene Edit
** Track Edit
** Scale select or just edit - probably not user extensible at first
** Grid (Clips)
** Clear Grid
** Save/Load

* flask server and backend thread with opcodes (each opcode takes JSON):

** opcodes for flask: LIST/ADD/EDIT/REMOVE for each
** SONG/{LIST,ADD,EDIT,REMOVE}, DEVICE, INSTRUMENT, SCALE, CLIP, PATTERN, ARP, TRACK
** DESCRIBE_GRID -- returns a lot of stuff to prevent too many extra calls
** PLAYER/PLAY_CLIPS
** PLAYER/STOP_CLIPS
** PLAYER/START_SCENE
** PLAYER/STOP
** FILE/LOAD filename.json
** FILE/SAVE filename.json

** how do we show the user what pattern symbols are invalid? -- need a method for validating patterns??
** more documentation in rockchisel - can wait until done, maybe move some to inline help?

* verify/fix some little things:
** scene repeat is not implemented
** track mute is  not implemented
** scene auto advance is not implemented
** scene measure length is not used
** pattern has a length setting but clip length setting should be honored to cut the pattern short

** is pattern overriding scale implemented?
** is pattern overriding tempo implemented?

* demo vids / songs / tracks
