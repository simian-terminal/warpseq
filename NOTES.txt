NOTES
=====

TODO


* RESET when past end of clip in player code
* multi-player testing for clip advance
* expand expressions to allow for more, like intra-track grab (ModExpression class)

* UI mockups (cursus interface)
** Instrument
** Pattern Edit
** Arp Edit
** Scene Edit
** Track Edit
** Scale select or just edit - probably not user extensible at first
** Grid (Clips)
** Clear Grid
** Save/Load

* how does communication work?  CLI sends whole structures to message bus, message bus plays? Or just multi-thread and serialize?  (perhaps easier for consumers, maybe easier to conceptualize)
* how do we show the user what pattern symbols are invalid?
* move to using more custom exception types
* more documentation on how to use (rockchisel) - started a bit, doesn't need a lot
* intra-track expressions


verify/fix some little things:
scene repeat is not implemented
track mute is  not implemented
scene auto advance is not implemented
scene measure length is not used
pattern has a length setting but clip length setting should be honored to cut the pattern short

is pattern overriding scale implemented?
is pattern overriding tempo implemented?
whatâ€™s the resolution order and do the docs match?


* demo vids / songs / tracks
