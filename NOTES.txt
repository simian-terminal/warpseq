NOTES
=====

BACKEND
=======

* more rockchisel docs (see docs/)

* we should change the mod expression delimiter to whitespace.

* build the "friendly" high level API and port the test/assembly.py example to it.
  use arrays, not strings, for lists of expressions in those API examples.

* cleanup various code

* increase error handling in expressions using custom exception types

* make a Ctrl-C hook that stops all notes

* demo script at launch should ask user to input their MIDI device name from a list

* UI planning and support service

* GUI interface idea: flask server and backend thread with opcodes (each opcode takes JSON):

** opcodes for flask: LIST/ADD/EDIT/REMOVE for each
** SONG/{LIST,ADD,EDIT,REMOVE}, same for DEVICE, INSTRUMENT, SCALE, CLIP, PATTERN, ARP, TRACK
** PLAYER/PLAY_CLIPS(list)
** PLAYER/STOP_CLIPS(list)
** PLAYER/START_SCENE
** PLAYER/STOP
** SONG/LOAD filename.json
** SONG/SAVE filename.json

** how do we show the user what pattern symbols are invalid? -- need a method for validating patterns??

** start free patreon posts

* demo vids / songs / tracks

* test slot_length (really this is the same as tempo, isn't it? -- do we need to expose it?)

* nice to have: the Roman notation class should be able to do IV7 and IV9 and not just IV, iv, etc.
