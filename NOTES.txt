NOTES
=====

RELEASE GATES
=============

* the default song should have a scale in it - C4 major should be fine. Let the user add more.

* test API needs to validate:
*   - kick/snare pattern repeat without pause
*   - next_clip w/o next scene
*   - basic chords 
*   - basic chords w/ tie
*   - basic notes with gap
*   - transform with octave shifts
*   - transform with scale degree shifts
*   - multiple patterns in sequence
*   - multiple patterns with octave shift
*   - single pattern with octave shift
*   - multiple patterns with tempo shifts
*   - silence events
*   - grab events
*   - midi CCs
*   - random choice
*   - random values
*   - pattern overrides scale
*   - scene overrides scale

* make a Ctrl-C/error hook that stops all notes

* we need a method that the API *must* call that validates patterns and transforms (slots) on save.

* API docs for web page

* demo script at launch should ask user to input their MIDI device name from a list

* test API save/load

* set up website publishing

* enable patreon page (= discord access)

FUTURE/IDEAS
============

* REST-ish JSON API with background thread

* callbacks for when clips start to play, scenes, other events

* nice to have: the Roman notation class should be able to do IV7 and IV9 and not just IV, iv, etc. (still can 4:M7)

* mod events that can reshuffle patterns?
