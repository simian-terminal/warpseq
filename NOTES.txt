* websocket notification callbacks to light up playing clips/patterns
* transform mode that has an auto length and only applies divide to chords
* web ui auto generation of interesting patterns in different types
* alternate pattern directions
* mod events that can reshuffle patterns?
* web UI ships with demo tracks that showcase lots of interesting features
