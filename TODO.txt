NOTES
=====

these will move to Trello soon:

IDEAS/PLANS
===========

* maybe multiple notes per line work to slice up the frequency?  they might be notated with "/" between them.
* mod expression for chord inversions (already implemented functions!)
* mod expressions for reverse/reshuffle pattern
* flag on transform to reset when pattern resets (?)
* REST-ish JSON API with background thread
* websocket notification callbacks to light up playing clips/patterns
* transform mode that has an auto length and only applies divide to chords
* web ui auto generation of interesting patterns in different types
* alternate pattern directions
* mod events that can reshuffle patterns?
* web UI ships with demo tracks that showcase lots of interesting features
