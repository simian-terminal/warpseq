=====

RELEASE GATES
=============

* fix tie code - what is up?
* verify intra-track example?
* code cleanup (timestream, mod parser)

* update webpages for demo songs
* set up website publishing
* enable patreon page (= discord access)

FUTURE/IDEAS
============

* mod expression for chord inversions (already implemented functions!)
* mod expressions for reverse/reshuffle pattern
* flag on transform to reset when pattern resets (?)
* code cleanup - if rests were note objects they could have mod expressions attached

* web interface
* REST-ish JSON API with background thread
* callbacks for when clips start to play, scenes, other events
* websocket notification callbacks to light up playing clips/patterns
* transform mode that has an auto length and only applies divide to chords
* web ui auto generation of interesting patterns in different types
* alternate pattern directions
* mod events that can reshuffle patterns?
* web UI ships with demo tracks that showcase lots of interesting features
